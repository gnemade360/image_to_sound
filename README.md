# Image to Sound Converter

Image to Sound Converter is a Python program that converts an image into sound. Each pixel of the image is mapped to an audio frequency, and the resulting sound is played in sequence. Please note that this approach does not produce meaningful sound but is a fun way to explore the relationship between images and audio.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the Image to Sound Converter program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library
- simpleaudio library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install Pillow simpleaudio


### Usage
